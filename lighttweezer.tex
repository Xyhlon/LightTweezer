\section{Tasks}\label{Auf}

During the experiment the following steps need to be performed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Build a microscope and observe forces on microscopic particles without a laser
	\item Use the laser as a "gun"\ to hit some microscopic particles
	\item Trap particles with the laser beam
	\item Trap "living" \ organisms
	\item Transfer a angular momentum to a particle
\end{itemize}

\section{Grundlagen}\label{Grund}

% Brownian motion connection to viscosity then connection to slope of squared displacement
% then connection between trap stiffness and holding force.
\subsection{Brownian Motion and Its Relation to Diffusion}

Brownian Motion is the random, erratic movement of particles suspended in a
fluid, discovered by Robert Brown in 1827. This motion results from collisions
with the molecules of the surrounding medium, which are in constant thermal
motion.

Diffusion Constant (D) quantifies how fast particles diffuse in a medium. It is
influenced by the temperature of the medium, the viscosity, and the size of the
diffusing particles.

Average Squared Displacement (ASD) measures how far particles move from their
original position, on average, over time. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
	\left \langle (\Delta x)^2 \right \rangle = 2 d D t
	\label{eq:brownian_motion_diffusion}
\end{equation}
where $\left \langle (\Delta x)^2 \right \rangle$ is the mean squared displacement,
$d$ is the dimensionality of motion, $D$ is the diffusion constant, and $t$ is
time.

\subsection{Fick's Law of Diffusion}

Fick's Law describes the flux of particles under a concentration gradient:

\paragraph{Fick's First Law:} Indicates that the particle flux $J$ is proportional to the negative of the
concentration gradient $\nabla c$:
\begin{equation}
	J = -D \nabla c
	\label{eq:ficks_first_law}
\end{equation}
\paragraph{Fick's Second Law:} Describes the time dependence of concentration due to diffusion:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 c
	\label{eq:ficks_second_law}
\end{equation}
This law shows how the concentration changes in response to
the diffusion spread, balancing out concentration differences over time.\cite{fickUeberDiffusion1855}

\subsection{Einstein Relation (Einstein-Smoluchowski Equation)}

The Einstein relation connects diffusion with the microscopic random motion
observed in Brownian motion. Einstein derived a formula linking the diffusion
constant $D$ with temperature $T$, the Boltzmann constant $k_B$, and the
mobility $\mu$ of the particles:

\begin{equation}
	D = \mu k_B T
	\label{eq:einstein_relation}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Derivation of the Einstein Relation from Fick's Law}

\paragraph{Equilibrium State:} Starting with Fick's First Law under the assumption of thermal equilibrium and
a potential energy $U(x)=−Fx$ due to a small applied force $F$:

\begin{align*}
	c(x)          & = c_0 e^{\frac{Fx}{k_BT}} \\
	\nabla c      & = \frac{F}{k_BT} c(x)     \\
	\Rightarrow J & = -D \frac{F}{k_BT} c(x)
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Mobility:} By definition, mobility $\mu$ is the velocity per unit force. Express the flux
$J$ also as $J=\mu Fc(x)$.

\paragraph{Equating Fluxes:} Equating the two expressions for $J$:
\begin{align*}
	\mu Fc(x) & = -D \frac{F}{k_BT} c(x)                                                  \\
	\mu       & = -\frac{D}{k_BT}                                                         \\
	D         & = \mu k_BT\qquad \# \text{with absorption of the sign into the definition
		of } \mu
\end{align*}

for spherical particles in a liquid with low Reynolds number one substitute the
mobility using the Stokes law for the frictional force:

\begin{align*}
	F_\text{Stokes}   & = 6 \pi \eta R v \\
	\mu = \frac{F}{v} & = 6 \pi \eta R
\end{align*}

and arrive at the Stokes–Einstein–Sutherland
equation.\cite{einsteinUberMolekularkinetischenTheorie1905}

\begin{equation}
	D = \frac{k_B T}{6 \pi \eta R}
	\label{eq:sto_ein_sut}
\end{equation}

Lastly one can equate the Brownian motion and the diffusion constant to get
the:

\begin{align}
	\left \langle (\Delta x)^2 \right \rangle                                         & = 2 d \frac{k_B T}{6 \pi \eta R} t                   \\
	\text{using the differential form:}                                               &                                                      \\
	\text{d}\left \langle (\Delta x)^2 \right \rangle                                 & =  \frac{d k_B T}{3 \pi \eta R} \text{d}t            \\
	\Rightarrow \frac{\partial \left \langle (\Delta x)^2 \right \rangle}{\partial t} & =  \frac{d k_B T}{3 \pi \eta R}\label{eq:slope_visc}
\end{align}

\subsection{Optical Trapping}

Overarching principle: due to the Gaussian form of the laser beam there exists
a stable location along the beam near the waist of the beam where particles are
attracted to. This fixes the position of particles in the first axis. How the
other two degrees of freedom are fixed is dependent on the particle size and
explained below:

% gradient rayleigh regime
\subsubsection{Rayleigh Regime}

In the Rayleigh regime, the particle size is much smaller than the wavelength
of the trapping light (usually less than about one-tenth of the wavelength).
Here, the particle can be modeled as an electric dipole induced by the electric
field of the light.

\paragraph{Gaussian Beam:}
A Gaussian beam, typically used in optical trapping, has a highly focused,
bell-shaped intensity profile. The electric field of such a beam varies
spatially, being strongest at the center and decreasing towards the edges.

\paragraph{Dipole Interaction and Gradient Force:}
The particle in a Gaussian beam experiences an induced dipole moment due to the
electric field. This dipole moment ($\vec{p} = \alpha \vec{E}$) is proportional
to the electric field $\vec{E}$, where $\alpha$ is the particle's
polarizability.

The key force at work here is the gradient force, which arises due to
variations in the light's electric field intensity. The force $\vec{F}$ on the
dipole is given by:
\begin{equation}
	\vec{F} (\vec{p} \cdot \nabla) \vec{E}
\end{equation}

This equation shows that the dipole (the particle) is attracted towards regions
of higher electric field intensity. In the Gaussian beam, this means the
particle is pulled towards the beam's center, effectively trapping it at the
focus where the intensity is maximal. This fixes the other two degrees of
freedom of the particle.\cite{bustamanteOpticalTweezersSinglemolecule2021}

% gradient trapping mie regime
\subsection{Mie Regime}

In the Mie regime, the particle size is comparable to or larger than the
wavelength of light. This regime would require considering the full solution to
Maxwell's equations for the interaction between light and the sphere, leading
to more complex behaviors than in the Rayleigh regime.

\paragraph{Geometrical Optics in Mie Regime:}
The geometric optics approximation can be used here, where the trapping light
can be considered as rays that get refracted and reflected as they interact
with the sphere. Each light ray imparts momentum to the particle according to
the change in the ray's momentum (light pressure).

\paragraph{Gradient Force:}
As in the Rayleigh regime, the gradient force still plays a crucial role but
its calculation becomes more complex due to the detailed interaction of light
rays with the particle. The distribution of light around the sphere creates
regions of varying intensity and gradient, and the sphere tends to move towards
the region of highest intensity. The geometrical momentum transfer and gradient
force is visualized below.\cite{bustamanteOpticalTweezersSinglemolecule2021}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/mieworkingprinciple.pdf}
	\caption[Working principle of optical tweezers in mie regime]{In black the original
		undisturbed rays are visible in red the rays refracted due to the solid sphere.
		The dashed circle depicts the resting position of the sphere and is the point
		where momentum transfer due to refraction is symmetric and horizontal
		components cancel. In blue one can see the momentum difference due to the
		refraction for the left and the right beam. Once the negative momentum are
		added one can see the trapping force acting on the sphere (in green).
	}\label{fig:mie_working_principle}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Momentum Transfer}\label{sec:momentumTransfer}

% Momentum transfer via kinetic light pulses

Photons are quantum particles of light and carry energy and momentum despite
having no mass. The momentum pp of a photon is related to its wavelength
$\lambda$ and energy $E$\cite{einsteinZurQuantentheoriederStrahlung1917}.The
momentum of a photon is given by the equation:

\begin{equation}
	p = \frac{E}{c}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Light Beam as a Stream of Photons}

A beam of light can be described as a stream of photons, each carrying energy
and momentum. When considering a beam of light, you can sum the momenta of
individual photons to understand the total momentum of the beam.

When light (photons) bends due to refraction, there's a change in the direction
of the photons' momentum. Since momentum is a vector quantity, any change in
direction implies a change in momentum.

If we consider the force $\vec{F}$ as the rate of change of momentum
$\frac{\partial\vec{p}}{\partial t}$ then a bending photon experiences a force
due to its changing momentum. According to Newton's third law, if the photon
experiences a force the opposite force is experienced by the object . Since a
force is defined as the time rate of change of momentum $\vec{F} =
	\frac{\partial\vec{p}}{\partial t}$, and a beam of light is a stream of photons
each changing momentum upon interaction with an object, the beam itself exerts
a force. This is observable in phenomena such as radiation pressure, where
light exerts pressure on surfaces due to momentum transfer from
photons.\cite{bustamanteOpticalTweezersSinglemolecule2021}

% Angular momentum transfer via circular polarized light

\subsubsection{Angular Momentum Transfer}\label{sec:angularMomentumTransfer}
To receive angular momentum and start spinning from polarized light, a
microscopic particle typically needs to exhibit certain properties such as
birefringence, non-spherical shape, and the ability to interact with the
specific polarization state of the incident light.

\paragraph{Birefringence:}
Birefringent particles can interact with polarized light to convert the angular
momentum of the photons into mechanical rotation. When a birefringent particle
is placed in an optical trap and illuminated with circularly polarized light,
the transfer of spin angular momentum can induce rotation. Transparent
birefringent particles like calcite can spin with high rotation frequencies
without overheating due to their
transparency.\cite{frieseOpticalAlignmentSpinning1998}

\paragraph{Non-Spherical Shape:}
Non-spherical particles, such as irregularly shaped birefringent particles,
show different rotational behaviors under polarized light. These particles can
exhibit periodic acceleration and deceleration due to varying spin angular
momentum transfer from the light.\cite{rothmayerIrregularSpinAngular2009}

\paragraph{Interaction with Polarization State:}
The state of polarization of the incident light (linear, circular, or
elliptical) affects how the angular momentum is imparted to the particle. For
instance, particles exposed to a circularly polarized light beam can experience
both spinning and orbital motion around the beam axis, as demonstrated in
experiments with Gaussian beams. \cite{angelskyCircularMotionParticles2012}

\paragraph{Absorption and Optical Properties:}
The optical properties of the particles, such as absorption and refractive
index, also play a significant role. For instance, gold nanoparticles can
achieve very high rotation frequencies when illuminated with circularly
polarized light due to their favorable optical properties and the low local
viscosity caused by particle surface heating.
\cite{lehmuskeroUltrafastSpinningGold2013}

\section{Measurement and Analysis}\label{sec:versuchsdurchfuehrung_messergebnisse}

In order to see how the uncertainty of the measurements propagates into the
results, the extended Gauss method was used. For the analysis python was used
in combinations with the packages \verb#scikit-learn#, \verb#numpy#,
\verb#opencv#, \verb#scipy#,\verb#matplotlib# and \verb#uncertainties#.

In order to ensure the highest possible accuracy, the values are not rounded
until they are displayed in tables.

\subsection{Microscope}\label{seq:durchfurung_microscope}

For this part only the microscope module form \autoref{fig:aufbau} is needed.

As a sample the Silicas are used. The object holder has a thin placeholder on
it, so that the tiny particles in the liquid are allowed to move, as visible in
\autoref{fig:object_holder}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width =0.5\textwidth]{./figures/Objekt_holde.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption[Object holder with placeholder] { Object holder with placeholder
	}\label{fig:object_holder}
\end{figure}

The object holder is placed on the specimen stage and the camera is connected
with the computer. The analyse of the sample is done with the "ThorCam"\
software. It is important to make sure that there is enough space between the
sample and the detector, to avoid a crash.

Now the white light LED under the sample is switched on in order to create an
image on the software. It is important to keep in mind, that there is a filter
between the sample and the camera to protect it later from the direct incident
of the laser. That's why the image appears in a greenish shine. Now the sample
is slowly moved upwards in z-direction to create a sharp image.

If the focus is set right, one can observe the Brownian motion of the small
particles. Some of them stand still, because the are attached either to the
objective holder or to the cover glass. With the electric controller one can
now navigate over the sample, by selecting an appropriate speed in the menu.

To measure the Brownian motion one needs a position on the sample where one
finds at east 3 moving particles at approximately the same size. Then ones
records the screen for at least 2 min to make an analyse of the movement of the
particles. One of these spots is visible in \autoref{fig:part_overview_1} and
\autoref{fig:part_overview_2}, as an example. The same procedure is again
carried out for another spot.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/I1_tracked.pdf}
	\caption[Capture 1 of particles]{This figure contains the initial conditions of the
		tracked region displayed in the background and has the trajectories of the

		coordinate grid. This is the first capture of particles.
	}\label{fig:part_overview_1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/I2_tracked.pdf}
	\caption[Capture 2 of particles]{This figure contains the initial conditions of the
		tracked region displayed in the background and has the trajectories of the

		particles. Furthermore, the particles are labeled and plotted on an x, y
		coordinate grid. This is the second capture of particles.
	}\label{fig:part_overview_2}
\end{figure}

Using the trajectories of the particles one can now calculate the effective
viscosity $\eta_\text{eff}$ of the liquid using the mean squared displacement.
The effective viscosity is calculated using the rate of change of the mean
squared displacements $s$. Solving the \autoref{eq:slope_visc} for the
effective viscosity $\eta_\text{eff}$ one gets:

\begin{equation}
	\eta_\text{eff} = \frac{2k_B T}{3\pi s R}
	\label{eq:eff_visc}
\end{equation}

But firstly one needs to calculate the mean squared displacements $s$ for each
of the particle trajectories.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/I1_particle_1.pdf}

		$t_n$) in X and Y direction and the radial direction R. The labels correspond
		to particles in \autoref{fig:part_overview_1}.
	}\label{fig:part_first}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption[Time averaged mean squared displacements from the particles of the second

		to particles in \autoref{fig:part_overview_2}.
	}\label{fig:part_second}
\end{figure}

Using the slope of the fitted lines $s$, the radius of the spherical particles
$R=\SI{2.06}{\micro\meter}$ and the medium temperature of
$T=\SI{308.15(15.00)}{\kelvin} = \SI{35(15)}{\celsius}$ we can calculate the
effective viscosity $\eta_\text{eff}$. Here the temperature was assumed to be
the \SI{20}{\celsius} above the room temperature. Since the irradiance of lamp
was heating up the liquid. This is the only uncertainty considered in the
calculation of $\eta_\text{eff}$. Since the RANSAC-Regressor was used to find
the slopes and this method of fitting does not provide uncertainties for the
fitted parameters. It would be possible to calculate the uncertainty of the
slope by using the least squares method for fitting after removing the
outliers. But this was not done in this case, since we use the obtained
effective viscosities to derive a representative effective viscosity using the
median statistic (for its robustness against outliers) is used for the $\mu$
estimator. This is allowed if the underling distribution is symmetric and with
finite mean has a median equal to its mean. This is the case if this estimator
will vary like a normal distribution and thus the error will be calculated
using the standard mean error.

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption[Collected effective viscosities]{This table contains the effective viscosities
		$\eta_\text{eff}$ of all the tracked particles from \autoref{fig:part_first}

		in the fluid considered in the measured effective viscosities. Using the median
		statistic and the standard mean error the estimator for the true
		$\hat{\eta_\text{eff}}$ is calculated.

It is important to keep in mind that starts to dry, and this makes the
particles drift towards an edge of the sample. This can be observed by a
"dry-wall" \ that starts to move over the sample, as visible in
\autoref{fig:dry_wall}

\subsection{Lasergun}
% Discuss and explain the observed effects. 
% What other mechanisms in light-matter interactions could be taken 
% advantage of to induce particle motion? 

For this part of the experiment the laser module without the telescope is added
to the setup, the exact setup can be seen in \autoref{fig:aufbau}. From now on
it is very important to keep in mind the principles of laser safety and use the
laser safety googles, when the laser is turned on. When everything is prepared
the laser can be switched on and the power can slowly be increased.

Once again the z-position of the stage needs to be increased until the focus of
the laser becomes visible in the plane. There are in total 3 positions where
the laser beam is visible which is shown in \autoref{fig:laser_focus}.

%todo pic laserfocus

When the laser is in focus one can try to kick some particles with the laser
beam by varying its power and moving it across the sample. This works on the
principal of the radiation pressure, where the momentum of the photons is
transferred to the particle. This was observed by the sudden movement of the
particle once the laser beam hits it. These principles were discussed in detail
in \autoref{sec:momentumTransfer}. Another way of inducing particle motion will
be discussed in \autoref{sec:AuswertungAngularMomentum}.

\subsection{Trapping with laser}
% Analyse the video again with the tracking tool used above. What’s the 
% difference in motion characteristics comparing a trapped to freely moving 
% particles? For better comparison, calculate again the squared displacements 
% now for the trapped particle. 
% Explain why more than one particle can be held within a single beam, and 
% which conditions must be fulfilled to do so. Discuss why particles are also 
% stably trapped outside the actual focal volume (at a lateral distance larger 
% than the beam size in the focus). 

The aim of this experiment is to trap a particle inside the laser beam. This
can be achieved by turning the laser to its highest power witch is at the
explicit case \SI{100}{\milli\ampere} and then bringing it close to a freely
moving particle. The soaking of the particle can be observed. By moving the
laser freely over the sample, the particle can be guided. By varying the power
of the laser one can observe holding force increases with increased power.
Furthermore, a size dependency was observed, smaller particles need less power
to be trapped.

To also increase the power of the laser beam, the telescope cage, visible in
\autoref{fig:aufbau}, is included to the setup, in order to focus the radiation
pressure of the beam. The interesting thing is, that the telescope didn't have
a visible effect on the trapping strength. This was a bit odd and will be
discussed in \autoref{sec:diskussion}.

Now one particle is trapped and slowly brought to a place on the sample, where
also some other particles of approximately the same size are freely moving, as
visible in \autoref{fig:part_overview_trap} and recorded to compare the
movement of the trapped particle with the freely moving one.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/III_tracked.pdf}
	\caption[Capture of trapped particle]{This figure contains the initial conditions of the
		tracked region displayed in the background and has the trajectories of the
		particles overlaid from cold to hot indicating the time evolution of the

		coordinate grid. This tracking captured two particles first particle (1) is
		free and the second particle (2) is trapped.
	}\label{fig:part_overview_trap}
\end{figure}

If we use the captured trajectories and calculate the mean squared
displacements for the trapped particle we can see the difference between
trapped and free clearly in the following \autoref{fig:part_trapped}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/III_particle_trapped.pdf}
	\caption[Time averaged mean squared displacements of trapped particle]{This figure one
		can see the time averaged mean squared displacements ($\left\langle \Delta s^2
			\right\rangle(t_n)$) (averaged up to every time step $t_n$) in X and Y
		direction and the radial direction R for the trapped particle. The labels
		correspond to particles in \autoref{fig:part_overview_trap}. Furthermore, the
		trapping was turned off at around step $n=1250$ to contrast trapped vs free.
	}\label{fig:part_trapped}
\end{figure}

Next will be demonstrated that catching 2 particles at the same time is
possible. When both particles are captured by the laser beam and the focus is
regulated a bit, by adjusting the z-position of the sample, the particles can
be stacked. In the image it looks like one particle, but when turning of the
laser one can observe both particles drifting away, as visible in
\autoref{fig:stacked}.

\subsection{Holding force}
% To calculate the maximum holding force (related to the trap stiffness), we 
% need the following dependences, laws, and parameters: 
% the frictional force is defined as FF = 6π ηeff R v (ηeff : effective viscosity of 
% liquid; R : particle radius; v : velocity relative to liquid). 
% To calculate the max. frictional force – equalling the maximum 
% holding force – from the measured maximum velocity, we also need 
% to know the effective viscosity.  
% The effective viscosity influenced also the Brownian motion studied 
% earlier. It depends on the mean squared displacement and, thus, also 
% on the linear slope of the corresponding curves you plotted before. 
% The slope is defined by s = (2 kB T) / (3π ηeff R) with the (room) 
% temperature T.

The aim of this experiment is to determine the holding force of the laser beam.
Therefore, it is important that the focus of the laser is perfectly aligned.
The aforementioned procedure was used to calibrate laser such that the force it
has the maximal force. When multiple particles are bunched together and then
the laser is able to align them this indicates, that this z-position is
maximizing the holding force.

Next we find the limiting speed of the laser movement, where the particle are
barely able to follow laser beam and remain trapped. To determine this the
speed of the movement can be regulated in the menu of the controller. In order
to find the correct speed we employed binary search, which means always try to
divide the search space in every step. It is critical to remain at the same
location while trying to find the correct speed, because at another location
there might be some contamination on which the trapped particle could get stuck
on. It is also important to keep in mind the drift due to the drying of the
sample, as already mentioned in \autoref{seq:durchfurung_microscope}. This
procedure is now repeated for different laser powers and for 2 different
particle sizes. The results are visible in \autoref{tab:velocities}.

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{This table contains measured velocities and whether the particle

Using the measured velocities and the effective viscosities from the
\autoref{tab:eff_visc} one can calculate the holding forces by equating the
frictional force with the holding force. The frictional force is described by
law of Stokes, which is given by the equation:

\begin{equation}
	\vert F_\text{trap} \vert =\vert k \Delta x \vert = F_\text{Stoke}  = 6 \pi R \eta_\text{eff} v
	\label{eq:holding_force}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Characterization of unknown sample}
% Experimentally characterizing the trapping performance in dependence on 
% the chosen particles.  
% Discuss and explain your findings. Compare them to the previous 
% experiments. 

% Todo mention Rayleigh regime since the particle are really small
% they probably smaller then the wavelength of the light
% this would also explain the purple colour of the particles
% they seem to nanoparticles of gold
% have a look at some literature is also structured light vo relevant

For this part the sample is changed. When removing the object holder it is
important to go down in z-direction with the sample stage in order to do not
hit the objective by changing the sample.

Now the objective colder can be cleaned and the new sample, labeled "unknown"\
placed on it.

When everything is attached and the laser beam is in focus again, one can try
to search new particles. What one immediately sees is, that the new sample
seems to contain particles that can absorb the laser beam, because one cam
"blow" \ them up.

%todo foto

What one can also observe with the bare eye is that the whole sample seems red,
although there are also e few particles inside it, so the have a huge coloring
effect.

\subsection{Trapping of living organisms}
% Discuss your findings and compare them to the previous experiments. 

For this part of the experiment one needs a sample with living bacteria on it.
Therefore, a gulp of "ayran" \ gets diluted with water to make it transparent.

When everything is aligned and the laser is switched on again, one can try to
find a bacterium. These bacteria can be easily detected due to their
non-erratic movement. These bacteria have a major and minor axis and have
cylindrical symmetry, once they enter the trap one can immediately observe,
that it stops its movement and its major axis aligns with the laser beam, as
visible in \autoref{fig:bacterium}. This happens, because this alignment is
energetically favorable.

These particles are probably staphylococci, because their more spherical nature
than streptococci. They also build smaller chains and this is in agreement with
the observation, that the longest chain was 3 long. Longer chains are
improbable since they would build cluster, which are also sometimes visible in
the sample.\cite{Bakterienformen} In order to verify this, one could use a gram
staining to differentiate between the two types of bacteria. Since they are
gram positive, they would appear purple in the staining. This happens, because
the cell wall is made of 40+ layers of murein, which is a peptidoglycan, and
the staining particle sticks to it in the deep layers. After a cleaning cycle
the dye would remain in the cell and the bacteria would appear purple. For
bacteria with fewer layers, like gram negative bacteria, the dye would be
washed out.\cite{ghazalMicrobiologicalHygenicDiscussion2024}

\subsection{Transfer of angular momentum}\label{sec:AuswertungAngularMomentum}
% If the light changes its angular momentum during the interaction, part of 
% this angular momentum must be exerted (partially) on the particle. Which 
% properties a microscopic particle should exhibit for the overall angular 
% momentum of the incoming light to change?

For this part of the experiment it is important to choose a particle, which has
the necessary properties to transfer the angular momentum of the laser to it.
This is the reason why, "vaterite" \ is used as a sample, since it birefringent
(see \autoref{sec:angularMomentumTransfer} for the other necessary properties
for this behavior). To avoid pollution of the "ayran"\ sample this sample is
placed on a new object holder.

When everything is aligned one navigates through the sample and searches for a
particle that looks round but has a slight asymmetry, to later observe
rotations of it.

To transfer the angular momentum of the laser to the particle one firstly needs
to change the polarization from linear to circular light. This is done by
holding a waveplate into the telescope and rotating it while observing the
trapped particle.

% Now, trap a particle with the circularly polarized light beam, record a video, 
% and discuss what you observe and what should you observe. 

Unfortunately the rotational effect was not as strong as expected. This can be
explained, because many parameters need to fit in order to create that effect.

\section{Diskussion}\label{sec:diskussion}

% probably we are in the second focus not the third which means that the particles are pulled to the 
% glass interface. This would explain a reduced holding force due to scraping and that the effective 
% viscosity conforms to the literature value. Furthermore this would
% also explain the why the angular momentum transfer didn't work.
