\section{Implementation and Measurement}\label{sec:versuchsdurchfuehrung_messergebnisse}

\subsection{Microscope}\label{seq:durchfurung_microscope}

For this part only the microscope module form \autoref{fig:aufbau} is needed.

As a sample the Silicas are used. The object holder has a thin placeholder on it, so that the tiny particles 
in the liquid are allowed to move, as visible in \autoref{fig:object_holder}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width =0.5\textwidth]{./figures/Objekt_holde.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption[Object holder with placeholder] {
		Object holder with placeholder
	}\label{fig:object_holder}
\end{figure}

The object holder is placed on the specimen stage and the camera is connected with the computer.
The analyse of the sample is done with the "ThorCam"\  software. It is important to make sure that there is enough 
space between the sample and the detector, to avoid a crash.

Now the white light LED under the sample is switched on in order to create an image on the software. 
It is important to keep in mind, that there is a filter between the sample and the camera to protect it later
from the direct incident of the laser. Thats why the image appears in a greenish shine. 
Now the sample is slowly moved upwards in z-direction to create a sharp image.

If the focus is set right, one can observe the brownian motion of the small particles. Some of them stand still,
because the are attached either to the objective holder or to the cover glass. 
With the electric controller one can now navigate over the sample, by selecting an appropriate speed in the menu.

To measure the brownian motion one needs a position on the sample where one finds at east 3 moving particles at 
approximately the same size. Then ones records the screen for at least 2 min to make an analyse of the movement 
of the particles. One of these spots is visible in \autoref{fig:pic_brownian_motion}, as an example.
The same procedure is again carried out for an other spot.

%todo pic

It is important to keep in mind that after looking at the sample some time it starts to dry, and gives the particles 
some kind of a drift towards the middle of the sample. This can be observed by a "dry-wall" \ that starts to move over the 
sample, as visible in \autoref{fig:dry_wall}

% todo pic dry wall

trocknung
\subsection{Lasergun}

For this part of the example the laser module without the telescope is added to the setup, as visible in \autoref{fig:aufbau}.
From now on it is very important to keep in mind the principles of laser safety and use the laser safety googles, 
when the laser is running.

When everything is attached to the setup the laser can be switched on and the power can slowly be increased.

Now again the z-position of the stage needs to be increased until the focus of the laser becomes visible in the plane.
There are in total 3 positions where the laser beam is visible which is shown in \autoref{fig:laser_focus}.

%todo pic laserfocus

When the laser is in focus one can try to kick some particles with the laser beam by varying its power and moving it 
across the sample.

\subsection{Trapping with laser}

The aim of this experiment is to trap a particle inside the laser beam. This can be achieved by turning the laser to 
its highest power witch is at the explicit case \SI{100}{\milli\ampere} and than bringing it close to a freely moving particle.
The soaking of the particle can be observed. By moving the laser freely over the sample, the particle can be guided.
By varying the power of the laser one can observe, that an explicit force is needed in order to trap the particle, depending on its size.

To also increase the power of the laser beam, the telescope cage, visible in \autoref{fig:aufbau}, is included to the setup, in order to 
increase the power of the beam.
The interesting thing is, that the telescope had no visible effect on the trapping of the particle.
%todo sag ma des e oder

Now one particle is trapped and slowly brought to a place on the sample, where also some other particles of approximately the
same size are freely moving, as visible in \autoref{fig:tapping} and recorded to compare the movement of the trapped particle 
with the freely moving one.

%todo trapping

Now one tries to catch 2 particles at the same time. When both particles are captured by the laser beam and the focus is regulated a bit, 
by adjusting the z-position of the sample, the particles can be stacked. In the image it looks like one particle, but when turning of the laser
one can observe both particles drifting away, as visible in \autoref{fig:stacked}.

%todo fig:stacked

\subsection{Holding force}

The aim of this experiment is to determine the holding force of the laser beam.
Therefore it is important that the focus of the laser is perfectly aligned. To check this one can try to stack 2 particles, 
as described before. When the particles can be stacked, the focus lies in the correct level.

Now one tries to find the speed of the lasermovement, where the particle can follow. To determine this the speed of the 
movement can be regulated in the menu of the controller. 
In order to find the speed one tries a binary search, which means always try to divide the interval in 2 sections of 
approximately the same size and so look for the speed stepwise.
It is important to always try for the same spot in the sample, because at an other position there could be other conditions 
and so the results can not be compared. It is also important to keep in mind the drift due to the dry of the sample, 
as already mentioned in \autoref{seq:durchfurung_microscope}.
This procedure is now repeated for different laser powers and for 2 different particle sizes.
The results are visible in \autoref{tab:movement}.

%todo tab movement


\subsection{Characterization of unknown sample}

For this part the sample is changed. When removing the object holder vit is important to go down in z-direction
with the sample stage in order to do not hit the objective by changing the sample.

Now the objective colder can be cleaned and the new sample, labeled "unknown"\  placed on it. 

When everything is attached and the laser beam is in focus again, one can try to search new particles.
What one immediately sees is, that the new sample seems to contain particles that can absorb the laser beam,
because one cam "blow" \ them up.

%todo foto

What one can also observe with the bare eye is that the whole sample seems red although there are also e few particles inside it,
so the have a huge coloring effect.

\subsection{Trapping of living organisms}

For this part of the experiment one needs a sample with living bacteria on it. Therefore a gulp of "ayran" \ gets diluted with 
water to make it transparent.

When everything is aligned and the laser is switched on again, one can try to find a bacterium. 
The can be easily detected due to the movement. When one traps the particle with the laser beam one can immediately observe, that
it stops its movement and aligns with the laser beam, as visible in \autoref{fig:bacterium}.

%todo bacterium




\subsection{Transfer of angular momentum}

For this part of the experiment the sample "vaterite" \ is used. To avoid pollution of the "ayran"\ sample this sample is 
placed on a new object holder.

When everything is aligned one navigates through the sample and searches for a particle that looks round but has a slight discontinuity, 
to later observe rotations of it.

To transfer the angular momentum of the laser one has to change its handyness. This is done by holding a waveplate into the telescope
and rotating it while observing the trapped particle.

Unfortunately the rotational effect was not as strong as expected. This can be explained, because many parameters need to fit in 
order to create that effect.

\section{Auswertung}\label{sec:auswertung}

Um zu sehen wie sich die Unsicherheit der Messungen bis in die Ergebnisse
fortpflanzt, ist erweiterte Gauss-Methode verwendet worden. Die Grundlagen
dieser Methode stammen von den Powerpointfolien von
% GUM~\cite{wolfgang_kessel_isobipm-gum_2004}. Für die Auswertung ist die
Progammiersprache Python im speziellen die Pakete \verb#labtool-ex2#,
\verb#pandas#, \verb#sympy#, \verb#lmfit# zur Hilfe genommen worden.
\verb#lmfit# wurde für das Fitten verwendet, \verb#sympy# wurde für symbolische
Manipulation verwendet und die restlichen Pakete für leichteres Handhaben der
Daten. Dies wurde aber alles durch \verb#labtool-ex2# abstrahiert.

Um höchstmögliche Genauigkeit zu garantieren wird erst bei der Darstellung der
Wert in Tabellen gerundet.
